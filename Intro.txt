Toontown is in need of serious expansion. But due to the finicky nature of Astron,
the DClasses, Uberdog, AI, etc., we just couldn't do it! But then Master Loopy had
a revolutionary idea that would change Toontown forever. It was time to cut the
crap and get busy in completely remastering Toontown. It was time to redo Toontown
at its core level. It was time for Toontown to take flight. IT WAS TIME!!!

Land of the Toons is different from other Toontown servers because it will do a lot
of things (if not everything) differently from anyone in the past. Master Loopy
feels that it is necessary to recreate nearly all aspects of Toontown's code from
the ground up and phase out things like DClasses and Astron. He also feels it is
necessary to split the TTLocalizer into several files for simplicity reasons.
